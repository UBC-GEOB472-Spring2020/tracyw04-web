Welcome to the README file for my lab 2 project!

Reflective analysis: My goal within this interactive map was to map out changes in lung and bronchus cancer mortality per state in the U.S.A. from 1999-2016.
The purpose of this map was to show if there are changes in total deaths in U.S.A. over these 17 years, as well as point out the main regions with the most number
of deaths. The purpose is to show the general audience, as well as state parties the states most affected, which can be beneficial when enacting state-specific 
health policies. The center of the map was based on the coordinates of the U.S. I decided then it would be interesting to take a look at how lung and bronchus 
cancer mortality changes over time. Hence, I took data from the CDC WONDER U.S.A. lung and bronchus cancer mortality for all genders, 1999-2016. I then merged 
to a geojson file so that I could create a chloropleth map. The idea was that I would create a chloropleth map that could allow interactivity for changes in maps 
by year,
