Reflective analysis:
My goal within this interactive map is to showcase the active fires in Australia on Christmas (December 25, 2019) last year. Data was taken from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from NASA satellite imaging. The idea that I had before starting the map, was to showcase each incidence as a red circle, making proportional circles based off the brightness (ie. Intensity of fire). The purpose of this map was to show regions in Australia that were affected on Christmas, as well as point out the main regions with the largest fire incidences. Hence, my goal was to draw each point as a proportional symbol, while highlighting the top 4 affected zones as well as neighboring big cities. Highlighted areas would be shown using interactivity. 
The background of the map was chosen to be a simple black vector background that listed major cities, as I really wanted to be able to highlight the fires (The red would contrast well with the black background). I decided to include a few contextual layers to provide more information, such as state boundaries, names of cities/country/states, hillshading and waterbodies. These variables can provide insight on what sort of areas was affected and who were affected. I wanted largest data value of brightness (477.4) to have largest radius size (being 10). I used the perceptual scaling formula to aid in distinguishing differences. I did not want too big in circles as I wanted the reader to see each state affected.
